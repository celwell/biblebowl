Things to burn onto final cd:

- "mainPackage" folder(and all of its contents)
- "images" folder(and of its contents)
- "picturesForQuestions" folder (will probably be empty)
- "questionFORMAT.txt"
- "questions.txt"
- "Sample Questions.txt"
- font files with directions on installing them
- eclipse and java runtime files



Note: I may want to make a usb flash drive with all of this on it too.
Note: I may want to copy onto the destination hard drive for better performance and less chance of problems
